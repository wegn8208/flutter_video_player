|             | Android | iOS   | Web   |
|-------------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Support** | SDK 24+ | 13.0+ | Any\* |

![The example app running in Android](https://github.com/likeconan/flutter_video_player/blob/master/demo_preview.gif)

## Installation

First, add `video_player_oneplusdream` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/using-packages/).

### iOS

If you need to access videos using `http` (rather than `https`) URLs, you will need to add
the appropriate `NSAppTransportSecurity` permissions to your app's _Info.plist_ file, located
in `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`. See
[Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsapptransportsecurity)
to determine the right combination of entries for your use case and supported iOS versions.

### Android

If you are using network-based videos, ensure that the following permission is present in your
Android Manifest file, located in `<project root>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

### Web

> Add below two links in your index.html
```
<link href="https://vjs.zencdn.net/8.0.4/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="https://vjs.zencdn.net/8.0.4/video.min.js"></script>
```
> Please check [video.js](https://videojs.com) documentation for details


## Supported Formats

- On iOS, the backing player is [AVPlayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avplayer).
  The supported formats vary depending on the version of iOS, [AVURLAsset](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avurlasset) class
  has [audiovisualTypes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avurlasset/1386800-audiovisualtypes?language=objc) that you can query for supported av formats.
- On Android, the backing player is [ExoPlayer](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/),
  please refer [here](https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/supported-formats.html) for list of supported formats.
- On Web, the backing player is video.js
